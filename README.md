*Informações atualizadas sobre COVID-19 que o Governo Federal tenta esconder.*

Soon available at [covidometro.info](http://covidometro.info/)


## Overview

Brazilian Federal Government (Bolsonaro's administration) is notoriously hidding information about COVID-19 in national territory and minimizing the crisis.

This dawn (2020-06-06), the portals [Coronavírus Brazil](https://covid.saude.gov.br/) and [Portal da Transparência](http://portaltransparencia.gov.br/) where shutdown (the first is "in maintenance" while the second just "can't be reached"). It could be a coincidence, if in the previous night the Ministry of Health (without a minister since 2020-05-15) hadn't stated they will recount the deaths allegedly overestimated.

Current government behavior suggest we are going to suffer a coup d'état. While this is not a reality yet, one small contribution one can do is try to inform people about the pandemic.
